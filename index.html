                    For the 3rd straight year, V-Con was held in both Penang, Malaysia and Dubai, UAE, with both record-breaking attendance. A rousing "DO IT NOW" theme headlined the two V-Conventions. Muniba Mazari, an inspirational woman whose life story drew much love and admiration from thousands of dreamers at V-Malaysia and V-UAE, added to a growing list of superstars that joined our family to be part of an unbelievable V-Con experience.
